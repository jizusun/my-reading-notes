> Everybody wants more time. While you can't make more hours in the day, you can find more time for the most important things in your life. In this course, Chris Croft introduces 5 simple time management tips to reduce distractions and stay focused on what matters.

> The first—saying no—is simple in theory, but hard in practice. Chris explains how to reclaim the power of "no" to make room for true priority items. The second step, negotiation, allows you to spend less time on unimportant tasks. The third way is to delegate sometimes, and the fourth is improving systems and processes so that repetitive tasks are quickly and easily managed. Last but not least, Chris explains how to overcome perfectionism and nitpicking. He explains how to apply the five methods to all time-stealers, including meetings, interruptions, and more.

> In the initial chapters, he'll help you clarify your life and work goals, prioritize to-dos using Eisenhower's matrix of tasks, and answers questions like "Does working longer hours actually get more done?" The worksheets included with the exercise files will help you apply the lessons to your own work and life, and hone your time management skills—one step at a time.

## 1. The Importance of Time Management
### The objective of time management
- Time management: Maximize time spent on important things
- Less time for unimportant things, and more time for important things
- I would hope that there is some correlation between you think is important and what your boss or your company think is important
- You can get away with neglecting important things - for a short time
- However, if you neglect important things, they will catch up to you.
- You'll pay the price of regret later.
- Goals should combine **enjoyment and achievement**

### The important of clear goals
- If an activity moves you towards your goals, it's important, and if it doesn't, then it's not important. It's as simple as that.
- Enjoy and achieve, both at home and at work
- Goals
    + Written down: far more likely to happen 
    + Specific: to be more clear
    + Positive: 
- Why do Goals Work?
    + They set your subconscious in the right direction: Without an internal SatNav, you'll drift through life, and end up somewhere that you probably don't want to be.
    + They increase self-discipline and assertiveness.

### Why you must make the most of every day
- How many weekends is left for you: 52 weeks per year
- Urgency and pressure leads to the important stuff being neglected. And then eventually, when it's too late, you pay the price of regret.

## 2. Prioritizing

### What prioritizing really means
- Prior: how important they are 
- Important but probably not urgent: for example your children
